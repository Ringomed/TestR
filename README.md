# TestR - an exam generating app

TestR combines the power of R and R Markdown with the interactivity of Shiny to deliver a multiple choice exam generating app. It allows the user to select questions based on the chapter and difficulty level. These choices are then used to randomly pick the selected number of questions from the question base. If the user is not satisfied with certain selected questions, they can be swapped with other questions from the same chapter-difficulty subgroup.
The app also allows the user to select different question bases or create new ones. The app opens up to a demo question base, but the user can also choose a built-in question base filled with multiple choice questions on various topics. If the user selects an empty folder, a new empty question base will be created.
The user can add, remove or change questions as well. Mathematical expressions are supported through Latex. The default format for generated exams and question bases is HTML, but you can easily convert it to pdf by opening the document on Chrome based browsers and choosing the ‘Save as pdf’ option from the print window.
The initial app tab offers a graphical overview of question base stats and a dark mode switch for long hours spent inputting the questions.  There is also a dropdown Help tab if you forget how to use a certain option.
